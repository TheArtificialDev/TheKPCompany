          The KP Company was founded by rebel-innovators who believe that creativity should be frictionless. Tired of clunky workflows and uninspired tools, we set out to build a suite of AI-powered products that empower Gen Z and early-career creatives to do their best workâ€”fast, bold, and free.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
          From our first micro-SaaS launch to a growing ecosystem of everyday utilities, our mission remains the same: eliminate barriers, spark ideas, and help you thrive in the creative process.
